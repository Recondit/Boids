# Boids
Boids is a simulation of the natural phenomenon of boids , usually exhibited by fish to prevent being singled out by predators.

I simulated with mesmerising phenomenon using the Pygame library by making each fish follow these 3 simple rule :
  1. Seperation : You need to steer away from other fish
  2. Alignment : Start moving towards the general heading of the other fish
  3. Cohesion : Stick with other fish by moving collectively towards the average position of other fish
  
The beautiful thing about this is , with just 3 simple rules , results in such a beautiful and lifelike simulation of an actual real life phenomenon.
Here is the result :
